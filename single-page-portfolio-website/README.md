## Task Requirements

### 1. General Page Layout
The page should have the following sections:
- **Header**: A title and navigation links styled with CSS.
- **About Section**: A brief paragraph introducing the individual (e.g., "About Me") styled with appropriate CSS properties.
- **Skills Section**: A list of at least five skills displayed using `<ul>` or `<ol>` and styled with custom bullet points or numbering.
- **Contact Form**: A styled data entry form (details below).

### 2. Contact Form
Include fields for:
- Name  
- Email  
- Message (textarea)

Add a **submit button** and apply CSS to:
- Style the input fields (e.g., border, padding, font size).
- Change the background color of the form.
- Apply hover effects to the submit button.

### 3. Styling Requirements
Use at least one of each:
- **CSS Selectors**: Element selector, class selector, and ID selector.
- **CSS Properties**: `margin`, `padding`, `font-family`, `color`, `background-color`, and `border`.
- **CSS Pseudo-Classes**: `:hover` and `:focus`.

Additionally:
- Style the navigation links in the header with a hover effect.
- Apply a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the page.

### 4. Page Structure
- Use semantic HTML for structure (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- Organize sections clearly and ensure the form is in its own `<section>`.

## Additional Guidelines
- Provide a visually appealing design by applying creative styles and effects.
- Focus on **readability** and **accessibility**, ensuring text contrasts well with the background.
- Write clean and well-organized CSS code, either embedded in the `<style>` tag in the HTML file or as an external CSS file.
