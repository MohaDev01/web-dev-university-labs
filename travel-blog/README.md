## Task Requirements

### 1. Homepage (`index.html`)
- Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- Create a navigation bar with links to the other pages: **Destinations**, **Travel Tips**, and **Gallery**.
- Include a welcome message inside a `<section>` element.
- Add an image with alt text describing the content of the image. The image should be appropriate for the theme (e.g., a scenic view or travel-related).

### 2. Destinations Page (`destinations.html`)
- Structure content using semantic elements:
  - Use `<article>` for each destination, with an image and a short description.
  - Include at least **three destinations**, each with its own `<article>`.
- Add headings (`<h2>`) for each destination and provide descriptive alt text for images.
- Ensure each `<article>` includes a **"Read More"** link that points to a detailed page (e.g., `destination1.html`), but creating these detailed pages is not required for this lab.

### 3. Travel Tips Page (`tips.html`)
- Include a list of at least **five travel tips**. Use `<section>` and `<aside>` where appropriate.
- Provide accessible labels for any images (e.g., alt text for tip-related images).
- Use proper heading levels for structure (e.g., `<h1>` for page title, `<h2>` for sections, `<h3>` for individual tips).

### 4. Gallery Page (`gallery.html`)
- Create a gallery using semantic elements (`<section>` or `<figure>`) to display at least **six images** related to travel.
- Each image should have a caption using the `<figcaption>` element and descriptive alt text.
- Organize the gallery layout to ensure readability and visual appeal.

### 5. Footer (Applies to All Pages)
- Add a footer with contact information and social media links. Use `<footer>` and provide accessible icons with alt text.

## Additional Guidelines
- **Images**: Each page must contain at least one relevant image with descriptive alt text.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all images have alt text, and each section has clear headings for a well-structured HTML layout.
- **Navigation**: Ensure that the navigation is consistent across all pages.
- **Style**: Basic styling can be added but focus on HTML structure over CSS for this lab.

## Submission
- Submit your HTML files and images in a zipped folder.
