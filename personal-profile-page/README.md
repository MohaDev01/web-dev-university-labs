## Lab Task

You are required to create a **Personal Profile Page** using HTML5 that includes the following components:

### 1. Title and Basic Structure:

- Provide a meaningful title for the page using the `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section.

### 2. Header Section:
- Include a `<header>` element containing your full name as an `<h1>` heading.
- Add a tagline or brief description about yourself in a `<p>` element within the `<header>`.

### 3. Profile Information Section:
- Create a `<section>` for profile information. In this section:
  - Add a sub-heading `<h2>` for "Profile Information."
  - Create a list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) to display at least three pieces of personal information  
    (e.g., your interests, hobbies, favorite programming languages).

### 4. Picture and Contact Information:
- Add a picture of yourself or a placeholder image in a `<figure>` element.  
  Provide a caption using the `<figcaption>` element.
